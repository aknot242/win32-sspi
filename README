= Description
This project is a fork of djbergers win32-sspi project which provided an FFI
implementation of SSPI on Windows. This project adds support for the SPNEGO/Negotiate
protocol.

The examples directory has two working examples to illustrate usage.
The sspi_ntlm_*.rb files are a client/server examples that use djbergers
original client/server implementations for ntlm.

The sspi_negotiate_*.rb files are client/server examples that use
the added SPNEGO/negotiate protocol.
